🌊 DWLR Groundwater Analysis — PCA & Correlation Study
A data-driven exploration of groundwater behavior using the DWLR Public Dataset (Kaggle)


📌 Overview
Groundwater is one of the most critical natural resources sustaining agriculture, drinking water supply, and ecosystem stability. With increasing climate fluctuations and unpredictable rainfall patterns, understanding the dynamics of groundwater levels has never been more important.

This project analyzes the DWLR (Digital Water Level Recorder) Dataset — 2023 and applies:

✔ Statistical preprocessing

✔ PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

✔ Feature extraction

✔ Correlation analysis

✔ Visual exploration of hydro-climatic relationships

The goal is to identify which environmental factors most strongly influence underground water levels, enabling researchers, policymakers, and developers to build predictive or monitoring systems.


📂 Dataset
This project uses the publicly available DWLR dataset from Kaggle.

🧠 Objectives

Clean & standardize hydrological data

Perform PCA to identify dominant factors affecting groundwater

Visualize correlations between rainfall, temperature, water level, and water quality

Highlight environmental variables with the strongest predictive power


📈 Key Insights

✔ Groundwater level is highly influenced by:

Temperature

Rainfall

Dissolved oxygen

pH (minor influence)

✔ PCA shows:

PC1 accounts for ~51% of total variance

Temperature and rainfall have almost equal contribution

PC2 and PC3 capture quality-related variations (pH, oxygen)

✔ Correlation analysis confirms:

Oxygen and temperature correlate with groundwater patterns

Rainfall intensity impacts temperature and soil-water interactions


🚀 Future Work

Build predictive models (LSTM, Random Forest)

Seasonal decomposition of water level trends

Mapping groundwater zones with GIS

Integrating satellite rainfall datasets
